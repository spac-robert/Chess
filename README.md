How to move the pieces:
	
Example: a2->a3

The first string(for example a2) before'->' represents the position of the piece we want to move and the string after the '->' represents the position where we want to put the piece.
The name of the column (A,B,C,..,H),doesn't matter if the character is uppercase or lowercase with the number of the row followed by '->' and the name of the column and the number of the row.
